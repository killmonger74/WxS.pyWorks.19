Hello &#x1F44B;

Welcome to a (not so boring ðŸ˜†) workshop in Python. lets ove forward ðŸ‘‡


## Why this workshop?

Any computer programming workshop is basically more or less a problem solving exercise. This time we will discuss why we need to have another Python workshop. Few reasons to have a Python workshop are as follows:-

1. Easy nature of Python.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

int main ( int argc, char ** argv[]){
    std::cout<< "Hello World";
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
compared to

```python
print ("Hello World")
```

2. Web development and Computer Graphics

    - The usability of Python for Web development can be understood from following projects:-
        - Youtube
        - DropBox
        - Google Search
    - The usability of Python in Computer graphics can be understood from following projects and libraries:-
        - PyGame
        - KTinker
        - Blackhole image generation.
        - Bokeh
        - Matplotlib

3.  Data Science and Machine Learning

     As it is quite easy to learn and work with Python is a natural choice for the data scientist and the machine learning engineers. Some of the popular Data Science and Machine Learning libraries are:-

    - NumPy
    - Theano
    - Keras
    - PyTorch
    - SciPy
    - Pandas
    - scikit-learn

If you have read upto here you can check _quite a big list_ of [success stories](https://www.python.org/about/success/) of projects done using Python.

## Modern day programming languages and Python

To understand why and how Python stood, where it is now we need to delve a bit into the history of Python. The points below discuss timeline of Python.

### Development of Python over time

- Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±.

- Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.

- Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.
